## LP2
My college repository for storing java exercises, in accordance with the Programming Language 2 subject being coursed. 

We're going to learn about all basics concepts around OOP (Object Oriented Programming):
- Classes and instances
- Method overloading
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Event Driven Programming

After being more familiar with these concepts, we will apply then by doing some tasks and creating some projects for us to hone our skills, and develop some graphic interface programms with the [Java 2d API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/2d/).
